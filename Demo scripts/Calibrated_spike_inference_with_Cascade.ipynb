At 30 Hz, a smoothing kernel of 50 ms works well, but a smoothing kernel of 25 ms could be tried as well if the data quality is good and if one wants to avoid temporally smooth predictions. If the calcium imaging quality is not ideal, it can make sense to increase the smoothing kernel standard deviation. In the end, it is always a trade-off between reliability and optimal learning (more smoothing) and temporal precision (less smoothing of the ground truth). The impact of temporal smoothing on the quality of the inference is discussed in Extended Data Fig. 9 in the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5).\n",

It must be noted that this reliable causal re-assignment of activity works well for high-quality datasets, but in case of higher noise levels, any deconvolution algorithm will assign activity to non-causal time points.

As also discussed in the CNMF-E paper, extraced traces therefore cannot be properly transformed into dF/F values. We therefore do not recommend Cascade for the deconvolution of this kind of dataset.
